Jun 03, 2016    2.1.0

  Change to UMD for AMD, Node, and browsers.

  Add `format` option to `toBuffer()` for parsing hexidecimal strings.


Jan 01, 2012    2.0.1

  Fix export in strict mode, changing `this` to `window`.
  
  Update documentations.


Mar 09, 2011    2.0.0

  Added 'Auto' hash functions, which choose a hash function by the 'size':
    - 'ripemd' => ripemd128, ripemd160
    - 'sha'    => sha1, sha224, sha256, sha384, sha512
    - 'sha2'   => sha224, sha256, sha384, sha512
    - 'skein'  => skein256, skein512, skein1024

  Stashed MD6 for possible, future development.

  Reduced Encoder to just RFC-4648 encodings and 'raw' (buffer) output methods.

  Reduced utility functions.
    - Removed atos, stoa, isInput, Encoder.ready.
    - Added 'toArray' for converting strings without encoding.
    - Added 'toBuffer' for converting strings with UTF-8 encoding.
      - All 'data' and 'key' Strings are passed through 'toBuffer', by default.

  Returned Rakefile to using ERB, adding Builder class to define bindings.
  
  Cleaned up code formatting in most files, all source.


Jun 18, 2010    1.3.0

  Add support for Node.js.
    - Required removal of `fn`.
  
  Revised Rakefile.
    - Removed intro/outro source files.
    - Replaced .\VERSION file with git-describe.
      - Adds commit count since tag as "revision."


Feb 02, 2010    1.2.1
  
  Add optional `size` argument too all hash functions.
    - Unifying hash result cropping.
  
  Removed string copyrights from hash files/closures.
  
  Made HMAC a private function.
  
  Switch from JSMin to Packr for minifying.
  
  Switch to QUnit for test suite.


Jan 15, 2010    1.2.0
  
  Added RIPEMD-160 (128).
  
  Reduced build to a single global closure:
    - Pre-define all merge/split functions (src/word).
    - Pre-define all UInt/ULong functions (src/math).
  
  Improved performance by employing better caching:
    - Change switch functions to cached arrays.
      - Add 'r' round variables.
    - Reduced uses of `ulong` in MD6 and SHA-512.
  
  Create a FireUnit test file.


Dec 23, 2009    1.1.1
  
  Bug fix release:
    - Base-64 encoding would fail in IE6.


Dec 13, 2009    1.1.0
  
  Combined jsDigest More into jsDigest.
  
  Revise basic hash functions to handle HMAC themselves.
    - Simplified HMAC, resulting in not being as well-suited for direct use.
    - Removed Digest.configure.
  
  Changed input encoding rules:
    - All Strings are UTF-8 encoded.
    - All Array elements are truncated.
    - Digest.Encoder objects treated the same as Arrays.
  
  Define utility functions for handling inputs:
    - Digest.atos -- "Array to String" conversion.
    - Digest.stoa -- "String to Array" conversion.
    - Digest.isInput -- Limit acceptable input types.
    - Digest.Encoder.ready -- Process an input per above encoding rules.
  
  Shrunk Digest.Encoder by limiting input encodings to Array output only.
    - `split`, `trunc`, and `utf8`
  
  Development:
    - Added copyright strings so they're included in minified build.
    - Moved common functions to the closures rather than inside an algorithm.
    - Reduced Exceptions thrown from jsDigest.
    - Removed `ulong` namespace/object, attaching functions directly to `Digest`.
    - Using `self` alias within closures.


Oct 31, 2009    1.0.5
  
  Fix missing padding of zero-length messages in MD6.
  
  Remove ANSI references, changing `ansi` to `trunc`.
  
  Explicitly set array lengths in Skein.


Oct 08, 2009    1.0.4

  Added Skein (256, 512, 1024) to jsDigest More.
  
  Change UTF-8 decoding in Digest.Encoder to prevent accidental decoding.
  
  Revise Rakefile:
  - Add memory for version number
  - Rename `include` to `import` to prevent conflicts/confusion
  
  Added jsDigest More details in README


Sep 27, 2009    1.0.3

  Added SCHEMA for variable-length hash functions.

  Add jsDigest More:
  - Including MD6-PAR and MD6-SEQ
  
  Development:
  - Renamed source files to shorten them.
  - Changed suffix names to `digest.js` (minified) and `digest-dev.js` (full)


Sep 27, 2009    1.0.2

  Order of arguments:
  - Function are a reduction of `(function, message, key, encoding)`.
  
  `ulong` helper functions:
  - Revised to reduce runtime.


Sep 21, 2009    1.0.1

  Digest.Encoder unicode support:
  - Rename `unicode` to `utf8` to be more specific.
  - Add UTF-8 decoding to Digest.Encoder.
  
  Encoding arguments:
  - Renamed `ansi` to `utf8` with default value of `true`.


Aug 12, 2009    1.0.0

  Initial release.
