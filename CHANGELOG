Jan 15, 2010    1.2.0
  
  Added RIPEMD-160 (128).
  
  Reduced build to a single global closure:
    - Pre-define all merge/split functions (src/word).
    - Pre-define all UInt/ULong functions (src/math).
  
  Improved performance by employing better caching:
    - Change switch functions to cached arrays.
      - Add 'r' round variables.
    - Reduced uses of `ulong` in MD6 and SHA-512.
  
  Create a FireUnit test file.


Dec 23, 2009    1.1.1
  
  Bug fix release:
    - Base-64 encoding would fail in IE6.


Dec 13, 2009    1.1.0
  
  Combined jsDigest More into jsDigest.
  
  Revise basic hash functions to handle HMAC themselves.
    - Simplified HMAC, resulting in not being as well-suited for direct use.
    - Removed Digest.configure.
  
  Changed input encoding rules:
    - All Strings are UTF-8 encoded.
    - All Array elements are truncated.
    - Digest.Encoder objects treated the same as Arrays.
  
  Define utility functions for handling inputs:
    - Digest.atos -- "Array to String" conversion.
    - Digest.stoa -- "String to Array" conversion.
    - Digest.isInput -- Limit acceptable input types.
    - Digest.Encoder.ready -- Process an input per above encoding rules.
  
  Shrunk Digest.Encoder by limiting input encodings to Array output only.
    - `split`, `trunc`, and `utf8`
  
  Development:
    - Added copyright strings so they're included in minified build.
    - Moved common functions to the closures rather than inside an algorithm.
    - Reduced Exceptions thrown from jsDigest.
    - Removed `ulong` namespace/object, attaching functions directly to `Digest`.
    - Using `self` alias within closures.


Oct 31, 2009    1.0.5
  
  Fix missing padding of zero-length messages in MD6.
  
  Remove ANSI references, changing `ansi` to `trunc`.
  
  Explicitly set array lengths in Skein.


Oct 08, 2009    1.0.4

  Added Skein (256, 512, 1024) to jsDigest More.
  
  Change UTF-8 decoding in Digest.Encoder to prevent accidental decoding.
  
  Revise Rakefile:
  - Add memory for version number
  - Rename `include` to `import` to prevent conflicts/confusion
  
  Added jsDigest More details in README


Sep 27, 2009    1.0.3

  Added SCHEMA for variable-length hash functions.

  Add jsDigest More:
  - Including MD6-PAR and MD6-SEQ
  
  Development:
  - Renamed source files to shorten them.
  - Changed suffix names to `digest.js` (minified) and `digest-dev.js` (full)


Sep 27, 2009    1.0.2

  Order of arguments:
  - Function are a reduction of `(function, message, key, encoding)`.
  
  `ulong` helper functions:
  - Revised to reduce runtime.


Sep 21, 2009    1.0.1

  Digest.Encoder unicode support:
  - Rename `unicode` to `utf8` to be more specific.
  - Add UTF-8 decoding to Digest.Encoder.
  
  Encoding arguments:
  - Renamed `ansi` to `utf8` with default value of `true`.


Aug 12, 2009    1.0.0

  Initial release.
